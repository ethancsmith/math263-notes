    "Side conditions must be imposed in order for a system of ODE's to have a unique a solution.  If all the side conditions are imposed at a single point, then the problem is called an initial value problem (IVP).  If the side conditions are imposed at more than one point, then we have a **boundary value problem (BVP)**.  In typical situations, the conditions are imposed at the endpoints (boundary) of an interval $[a,b]$, which of course explains the name.  \n",

    "## The shooting method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **shooting method** is a trick for turning this type of problem into a \"sequence\" of problems that we already know how to solve.  The idea is to replace the BVP by an IVP with unknown parameters.  In particular, we ignore any conditions imposed on $\\mathbf{y}(b)$ by the boundary condition {eq}`boundary-conditions`.  Then we fix any values of the vector $\\mathbf{y}(a)$ that can be determined from the start; the rest we treat as unknowns.  We then \"guess\" the unknown parameters in $\\mathbf{y}(a)$ and solve the resulting IVP.  We then check to see if numerical result satisfies {eq}`boundary-conditions` to within desired tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider for example the second-order BVP\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: bvp-example\n",
    "y''  &= 4y,\\\\\n",
    "y(0) &= 0,\\\\\n",
    "y(1) &= 5.\n",
    "```\n",
    "First we let $u_0 = y$, $u_1 = y'$, and we rewrite the BVP {eq}`bvp-example` as\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "u_0' &= u_1,\\\\\n",
    "u_1' &= 4u_0,\\\\\n",
    "u_0(0) &= 0,\\\\\n",
    "u_0(1) &= 5.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then we collect the new variables into vectors $\\mathbf u = \\langle u_1, u_2\\rangle$, $\\mathbf{f}(x, \\mathbf u) = \\langle u_1, 4u_0\\rangle$, and $\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{u}(0), \\mathbf{u}(1)) = \\langle u_0(0), u_0(1)-5\\rangle$, and observe that the problem is now expressed in the form of {eq}`first-order-system-ode` and {eq}`boundary-conditions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the shooting method, we ignore what the boundary condition $\\mathbf{g} = \\mathbf 0$ has to say about $\\mathbf u(1)$.  Instead we introduce another unknown parameter $s$, and we consider the IVP\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: IVP-family\n",
    "\\mathbf{u}' &= \\mathbf{f}(x, \\mathbf{u}),\\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{u}(0) &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0\\\\ s\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The goal then is to find a value of $s = u_1(0) = y'(0)$ so that when we solve the resulting IVP $u_0(1)\\approx 5$, i.e., $|u_0(1) - 5|$ is within a specified tolerance.  Below we make an initial guess of $s = 1$ and solve the IVP with $n = 10$ steps of RK4."

    "This time we are too high, and that is fortunate for now we have \"bracketed\" $s$.  In particular, we \"know\" (assuming that the solution varies continuously with $s$) that $s\\in (2,3)$.  We can therefore bisect the interval and guess $s=(2+3)/2=5/2$.  If that guess is too low, we know that $s\\in(5/2, 3)$.  If it is too high, we know that $s\\in (2, 5/2)$.  We can then keep bisecting until our computed value $u_{0,n} = y_n$ is within some desired tolerance of our target $y(1)=5$.  In practice, it is a good idea to set a maximum number of iterations in case the convergence is rather slow and the work cost is too high."
