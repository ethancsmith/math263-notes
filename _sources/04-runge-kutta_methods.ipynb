    "Recalling our analysis of Euler's method, it is clear that we could obtain a higher order method if our recurrence for generating the $y_i$'s agreed with more terms of the Taylor series for $y_*$, the true solution to the ODE that passes through the point $(x_i, y_i)$.\n",
    "The **Runge–Kutta methods** are a family of numerical methods which generalize both the methods of Euler and Heun.\n",
    "As with Heun's method, the essence of the idea is to use additional terms of the Taylor series without actually computing the higher order derivatives and instead replacing each with some finite difference approximation.\n",
    "The Runge-Kutta method of order $1$ is Euler's method. Heun's modified Euler method is an example of an order $2$ Runge–Kutta method."
