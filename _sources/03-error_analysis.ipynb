    "# 3: Error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, numerical methods suffer from two distinct sources of error.\n",
    "1. **Rounding error** is error introduced due to the use of finite precision arithmetic.\n",
    "1. **Truncation error** (or **discretization error**) is the error introduced by explicit approximations made in the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is important, we will largely ignore rounding error in this course.\n",
    "Instead we will focus on understanding truncation error, which would remain present even if all arithmetic was performed exactly.\n",
    "Truncation error can be discussed in two different forms.\n",
    "The **local truncation error** is the error made in just one step of a numerical method.\n",
    "In particular, we assume that the previous computed value $y_{i}$ is exactly correct, and then we compute the error at the next step, i.e., the local truncation error in the $(i+1)$st step is the quantity\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\ell_{i+1} = y_*(x_{i+1})- y_{i+1},\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $y_*$ is the true solution to the ODE that passes through the point $(x_{i}, y_{i})$, but not necessarily to the given IVP.  Put another way, the local truncation error is the extent to which the true solution fails to satisfy the formula the method uses to produce the $(i+1)$st approximation.\n",
    "The **global truncation error** in the $(i+1)$st step is the difference between the the true solution value and the computed solution, i.e., it is the quantity \n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "e_{i+1} = y(x_{i+1}) - y_{i+1},\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $y$ is the true solution to the given IVP.\n",
    "\n",
    "When solving an IVP, the global truncation error and the local truncation error always agree at the first step.\n",
    "Although it is potentially misleading, the global truncation error may be viewed as the accumulation of local errors made at all previous steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The order of a numerical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions of a real variable $x$ and that both are defined on an open interval containing $x=a$ except possibly at $x=a$ itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:definition}\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that $f$ **is at most the of order $g$ as $x$ tends toward $a$**, and we write\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "f(x) = O\\big(g(x)\\big)\\text{ as } x\\to a\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "if there are constants $M, \\delta>0$ so that\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "|f(x)|\\le M|g(x)|\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "for all $x$ so that $0<|x-a|<\\delta$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For any reasonable numerical method, both the local and the global truncation errors should tend to zero as the step size $h = x_{i+1}-x_i$ tends to zero.\n",
    "So, we are usually interested in bounding errors as functions of $h$ which are tending toward zero as $h\\to 0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:definition}\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a numerical method has **order $p$** if the global trunctation error is $O\\big(h^p\\big)$ as $h\\to 0$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since $h$ is tending toward zero, larger values of $p$ are preferred since higher degree monomials vanish faster near the origin than lower degree monomials do.\n",
    "For example, $h^3$ vanishes more quickly than $h^2$ which vanishes more quickly than $h$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "In many situations, if the local truncation error $\\ell_{i+1} = O\\big(h^{p+1}\\big)$ as $h\\to 0$, then the global truncation error $e_{i+1} = O\\big(h^p\\big)$ as $h\\to 0$.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, we argue _heuristically_ as follows.\n",
    "Suppose that we are numerically approximating the solution to an IVP on the interval $[a,b]$ with step-size $h=(b-a)/n$ and that the local truncation error $\\ell_{i+1} = O\\big(h^{p+1}\\big)$ as $h\\to 0$.\n",
    "Then the global error $e_{n} = y(b) - y_n$ arises from the accumulation of $n = (b-a)/h$ local errors.\n",
    "Whence\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "e_n = y(b) -y_n = \\frac{b-a}{h}O\\big(h^{p+1}\\big) = O\\big(h^p\\big) \\text{ as }h\\to 0.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Note well that this is only a heuristic argument and not a proof.  Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, local truncation error is easier to determine analytically than global truncation error, \n",
    "and so we will provide analytic \"evidence\" for the order of numerical methods based on local truncation error.\n",
    "However, global truncation error is usually easier to measure empirically for test problems where the exact symbolic solution is known.\n",
    "We will therefore compute global errors for our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis of Euler's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that if $y$ has $p$ derivatives at $x_0$, then the **Taylor polynomial of order $p$ about $x=x_0$ for $y$** is\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\sum_{j=0}^p \\frac{y^{(j)}(x_0)}{j!}(x-x_0)^j = y(x_0) + y'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \\frac{y''(x_0)}{2}(x-x_0)^2 + \\dots + \\frac{y^{(p)}}{p!}(x-x_0)^p.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "For $x$ near $x_0$, the Taylor polynomial of order $p$ is the best polynomial approximator of $y$ with degree less than or equal to $p$.\n",
    "The error in the approximation is usually quantified using Lagrange's remainder theorem.\n",
    "The following fact is a simplified version of Lagrange's theorem that is convenient for our purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{prf:theorem} Lagrange's remainder theorem\n",

    "y(x_{i+1}) = \\sum_{j=0}^p \\frac{y^{(j)}(x_i)}{j!}h^j + O\\big(h^{p+1}\\big)\\text{ as }h\\to 0,\n",
