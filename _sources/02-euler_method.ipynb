    "The distance $h_i=x_{i+1}-x_i$ is called the $i$th **step-size**, which may be variable.\n",

    "Once the mesh points have been chosen, the most straightforward approach to computing the $y_i$'s is known as Euler's method.\n",
    "It is the method that [Katherine Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdxYsVniOYo) and her team used to compute (mostly by hand) the path that the Apollo astronauts would follow to land on the moon.\n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y(x_1)\\approx y_0 + f(x_0, y_0)h.\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Whence choosing $y_1 = y_0 + hf(x_0, y_0)$, we have $y_1\\approx y(x_1)$ as desired.\n",
    "Continuing in this fashion, **Euler's method** is defined by the recurrence\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "y_{i+1} = y_i + f(x_i, y_i)h\n",
