    "## Ordinary differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **ordinary differential equation (ODE)** is an equation relating the derivatives of some unknown function $y$ of a single variable $x$.  To solve the equation is to find the full family of functions satisfying the equation.  Typically, there are infinitely many solutions to a given ODE if there is a solution at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **order** of the ODE is highest order of derivative that appears in the equation.\n",
    "A typical first-order ODE can be expressed in the form\n",

    ":label: first-order-ode-form\n",
    "y' = f(x,y).\n",

    "A differential equation together with one or more initial values is called an **initial-value problem (IVP)**.\n",
    "Typically, the number of initial values needed to obtain a unique solution is equal to the order of the differential equation.\n",

    "## Direction fields for first-order ODE's.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **direction field** (or **slope field**) is a graphical visualization for an ODE consisting of short line segments which are tangent to the unique solution to the ODE that passes through the midpoint of the line segment.\n",
    "Given an ODE of the form {eq}`first-order-ode-form` a direction field can be generated by evaluating $f$ on a **mesh** of points in the $xy$-plane and sketching a line segment with slope $f(x,y)$ at the mesh point $(x,y)$.\n",

    "## Creating direction fields with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we generate a direction field with window $[-3, 3]\\times [-2, 2]$ for the ODE {eq}`example-01`.\n",
    "We use two popular Python packages for this task.\n",
    "The [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) package provides efficient routines and data structures for scientific computing.\n",
    "[MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) is a visualization library."
