    "The reason that the above example behaves so poorly is that the desired solution is surrounded by other rapidly decaying transient solutions to the ODE.  The fact that these other solutions converge to our desired solution as $t\\to\\infty$ should help dampen out the errors in our numerical methods, but the problem here is that the convergence is (relatively) too fast.  It is as though the equation is too stable causing the numerical method to become unstable.  This condition is known as **stiffness**.  \"Physically, stiffness corresponds to a process whose components have highly disparate time scales or a process whose time scale is very short compared to the interval over which it is being studied (Heath. _Scientific Computing_, 2e., 2002).\"\n",
